# 🔬 Advanced Computer Vision Workspace: Healthcare & AgTech Solutions

**🏆 Multi-Domain AI Suite featuring High-Precision Segmentation and Edge-Ready Classification**

## 📖 Project Overview

This repository contains two production-ready Computer Vision engines developed to solve complex visual tasks in high-stakes industries. By bridging **Medical Diagnostics** and **Precision Agriculture**, this workspace demonstrates a versatile mastery of modern Deep Learning architectures, including **Residual U-Net (ReUNet)** and **MobileNetV2**.

Due to the significant computational resources required for training (approx. 3 days), this repository includes **pre-trained weights** and **detailed performance reports** for immediate verification.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture & Engines

### **1. Healthcare: Brain Tumor MRI Segmentation**

* **Architecture**: Implemented a **Residual U-Net (ReUNet)** to handle fine-grained boundary detection in 2D MRI slices.
* **Optimization**: Developed custom **Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC)** and **Dice Loss** functions to overcome the high class-imbalance inherent in medical imaging.
* **Rigor**: Evaluation includes **Pixel-wise Confusion Matrices** and Heatmaps generated via Seaborn to ensure clinical-grade precision.

### **2. AgTech: Plant Disease Detection**

* **Architecture**: Utilized **MobileNetV2** with **Transfer Learning**, optimized for lightweight deployment on mobile or edge devices.
* **Scale**: Trained on a dataset of **70,000+ images** across **38 distinct plant disease classes**.
* **Results**: Achieved a robust **91.73% Validation Accuracy** with a final validation loss of 0.2475.
